## Broadleaf Commerce Community Module

# Menu Module

Broadleaf Commerce currently offers a community abstraction Menu module that allows managing Categories and Site Navigation in
terms of Menus in the Admin much easier.

This module provides a Thymeleaf MenuProcessor that will add a list of MenuItemDTOs to the model. A Menu can contain Menu Items of
different types: "Link", "Category", "Page", "Submenu", "Product", or "Custom"

## Initial Configuration

The `1.0.0-GA` version of the Menu module requires Broadleaf version `3.2.0-GA` or later.

For detailed instructions on how to integrate the content test module into your project, see [[Module Installation]].
